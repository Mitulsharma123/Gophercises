Create an http.Handler that will look at the path of any incoming web request and determine if it should redirect the user to a new page, much like URL shortener would.

For instance, if we have a redirect setup for /dogs to https://www.somesite.com/a-story-about-dogs we would look for any incoming web requests with the path /dogs and redirect them.

Steps:
Implement the stubbed out methods in handler.go. There are a good bit of comments explaining what each method should do, and there is also a main/main.go source file that uses the package to help you test your code and get an idea of what your program should be doing.
Parsing the YAML using the gopkg.in/yaml.v2 package
Convert the data into a map and then use the MapHandler to finish the YAMLHandler implementation
